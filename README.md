## Usage

### ➡️ Run solutions for a day

```sh
# example: `cargo solve 01`
cargo solve <day>

# output:
#     Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.13s
#     Running `target/debug/01`
# Part 1: 42 (166.0ns)
# Part 2: 42 (41.0ns)
```

The `solve` command runs your solution against real puzzle inputs. To run an optimized build of your code, append the `--release` flag as with any other rust program.

### ➡️ Run all solutions

```sh
cargo all

# output:
#     Running `target/release/advent_of_code`
# ----------
# | Day 01 |
# ----------
# Part 1: 42 (19.0ns)
# Part 2: 42 (19.0ns)
# <...other days...>
# Total: 0.20ms
```

This runs all solutions sequentially and prints output to the command-line. Same as for the `solve` command, the `--release` flag runs an optimized build.

### ➡️ Benchmark your solutions

```sh
# example: `cargo time 8 --store`
cargo time <day> [--all] [--store]

# output:
# Day 08
# ------
# Part 1: 1 (39.0ns @ 10000 samples)
# Part 2: 2 (39.0ns @ 10000 samples)
#
# Total (Run): 0.00ms
#
# Stored updated benchmarks.
```

The `cargo time` command allows you to benchmark your code and store timings in the readme. When benching, the runner will run your code between `10` and `10.000` times, depending on execution time of first execution, and print the average execution time.

`cargo time` has three modes of execution:

 1. `cargo time` without arguments incrementally benches solutions that do not have been stored in the readme yet and skips the rest.
 2. `cargo time <day>` benches a single solution.
 3. `cargo time --all` benches all solutions.

By default, `cargo time` does not write to the readme. In order to do so, append the `--store` flag: `cargo time --store`.

> Please note that these are not _scientific_ benchmarks, understand them as a fun approximation. 😉 Timings, especially in the microseconds range, might change a bit between invocations.
